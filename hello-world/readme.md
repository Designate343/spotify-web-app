Basically just random stuff using the spotify API to learn some FE development


TODOS;
Make table view of most popular tracks a bit nicer and more uniform (i.e. long titles make list weird)
Give more info (i.e. images) on search function + recomendations (maybe have 1 model for a track and display uniformally)

Can build recomendations from parameters, e.g. attributes of the track see https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-recommendations/
