Basically just random stuff using the spotify API to learn some FE development

To use start a HTTP server in this directory e.g.
`python3 -m http.server` 

Then load `http://localhost:8000/login/login.html` login etc. and then use find your most popular tracks


TODOS;
- Make table view of most popular tracks a bit nicer and more uniform (i.e. long titles make list weird)
- Give more info (i.e. images) on search function + recomendations (maybe have 1 model for a track and display uniformally)
- Beautify
- Some metrics on most popular genres and song types etc? Might be quite interesting
