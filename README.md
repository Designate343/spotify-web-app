# spotify-web-app

Exploring the spotify public API. It is mostly a website that finds a playlist of your most popular tracks (as far as spotify supports it) and adding them to 
your Spotify account, with some vaguely nice visuals ('vaguely nice' being a highly subjective take and whether you agree probably depends on whether you think
centering is the height of design)

Made a vue version first then tried it in react to see what the differences were, they both should be the same but the react one might be cleaner (although 
react seems to want you to store all data and operations on that data in one module, then views in others...??? Not sure if I 100% love that idea but Its probably
smarter than that)
