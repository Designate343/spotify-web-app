# spotify-web-app

Exploring the spotify public API. It is mostly a website that finds a playlist of your most popular tracks (as far as spotify supports it) and adding them to 
your Spotify account, with some vaguely nice visuals ('vaguely nice' being a highly subjective take and whether you agree probably depends on whether you think
centering is the height of design)

Made a vue version first then tried it in react to see what the differences were.
